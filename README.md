# Garbha_Kalyani

**GarbhaKalyani** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide holistic and personalized Ayurvedic prenatal care.  
This project integrates the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda with advanced generative AI to deliver accessible, safe, and context-aware advice for expecting mothers.  
It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GPT-based models to generate responses tailored to the user’s pregnancy stage, health conditions, and Ayurvedic constitution (Prakriti).

## Methodology

### System Architecture
- **LangChain:** Conversational modeling and pipeline orchestration.  
- **ChromaDB:** Vector database for Ayurvedic document retrieval.  
- **LangGraph:** Manages conversation state transitions and dialogue flow.  
- **Stateful Memory:** Preserves user history and continuity across sessions.

### Prompt Engineering
- Techniques used: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and context-based prompting.  
- Context-based prompting combined with RAG yielded the most accurate and relevant responses.

### Evaluation
- Quantitative metrics include precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Qualitative validation performed through expert review of Ayurvedic content.  
- Comparative evaluation highlighted GarbhaKalyani’s superior contextual understanding and accuracy.
